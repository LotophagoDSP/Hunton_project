# Requirements
You need a *bash* shell and *python3*.

## Get the code
First get the code:

    git clone https://github.com/LotophagoDSP/Hunton_project && cd Hunton_project

## How to run
Then just Run 

    bash setup.sh

This will install all needed dependencies into a virtual environment and start jupyter.
In Jupyter you can execute all cells manually or just click on "Kernel" -> "Restart & run all".

The final product will be a python script buut developing in jupyter is much faster.
