## How to run
You need a bash shell and python3.
Then just Run 

    bash setup.sh

This will install all needed dependencies into a virtual environment and start jupyter.
In Jupyter you can execute all cells manually or just click on "Kernel" -> "Restart & run all".

The final product will be a python script buut developing in jupyter is much faster.
